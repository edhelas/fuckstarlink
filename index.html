    <h2>Why this initiative?</h2>

    <p>It seems that you accessed a website using Starlink or a similar mega-constellation network. Or maybe you want to understand why the service they are delivering to a few is bigger than the harm they do to our societies and our environment.</p>

    <p>We are not supporting the deployment of those mega-constellations to access the Internet:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Because they are creating a huge amount of debris in space: <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/wastex-environmental-harms-of-satellite-internet-mega-constellations/">WasteX
            Environmental harms of satellite internet mega-constellations - Lucas Rockett Gutterman, U.S. PIRG Education Fund, August 8, 2024</a></li>
        <li>Because the reentry from low-Earth orbit generates aluminum oxide nanoparticles that can cause significant ozone depletion on the long-term: <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL109280">Potential Ozone Depletion From Satellite Demise During Atmospheric Reentry in the Era of Mega-Constellations José P. Ferreira, Ziyu Huang, Ken-ichi Nomura, Joseph Wang, 11 June 2024</a></li>
        <li>Because they are causing serious impact on the observation of space: <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/04/aa37501-20/aa37501-20.html">Impact of satellite constellations on astronomical observations with ESO telescopes in the visible and infrared domains, Olivier R. Hainaut and Andrew P. Williams, 27 February 2020</a>. Astronomers <a href="https://www.space.com/astronomers-night-sky-protection-starlink-megaconstellations">are alredy asking UN to protect night skies from mega-constellations</a>.</li>
        <li>Because several companies are already launching <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellites.html"></a>their own mega-constellation of satellites</a>. In a few years tens of thousands of those satellites (up to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-starlink-satellites-internet">42.000 for Starlink</a>) will fly upon us, their short lifespan will require to launch each years thousands of new ones to maintain the fleet, causing important CO2 and methane emissions as well as mainy other environmental impact.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-left: 1rem; font-style: italic;">Our environnement, our climate and our sky is a common good that is too precious to be privatized to bring Internet acces for a few priviledges humans.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>I am using Starlink for [reasons] and I still want to have access to those blocked websites</h2>

    <p>Use a VPN.</p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

    <p>All the private companies running those mega-constellations own a few blocks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP (v4 and v6)</a> ranges, we are simply blocking those IPs and redirecting them to this website.</p>

    <h2>I want to support the initiative</h2>

    <p>You can contribute to the project on <a href="https://github.com/edhelas/fuckstarlink">Github</a> by improving the blocked IP lists or find new way to apply this list on services.</p>

    <h2>How do I block Starlink & co myself?</h2>

    <img src="img/mypart.webp">

    <h3>I host websites on nginx</h3>

    <p>Put the <a href="configs/nginx/fuckstarlink.conf" target="_blank">IP blocks file</a> in your <code>/etc/nginx/conf.d/</code> directory.</p>
    <p>Add the following code snippet to all the websites you want to block:</p>

    <pre>
server {
    ...

    location = / {
        if ($starlink_user) {
            rewrite ^ https://fuckstarlink.org/;
        }
    }
    ...
}
    </pre>

    <p>To be completed with other services...</p>
