    <p>It seems that you accessed a website using Starlink or a similar mega-constellation network. Or maybe you want to understand why the service they are delivering to a few is less important than the harm they do to our societies and our environment.</p>

    <p>We are not supporting the deployment of those mega-constellations to access the Internet:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Because they are creating a huge amount of debris in space: <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/wastex-environmental-harms-of-satellite-internet-mega-constellations/">WasteX
            Environmental harms of satellite internet mega-constellations - Lucas Rockett Gutterman, U.S. PIRG Education Fund, August 8, 2024</a></li>
        <li>Because the reentry from low-Earth orbit generates aluminum oxide nanoparticles that can cause significant ozone depletion on the long-term: <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL109280">Potential Ozone Depletion From Satellite Demise During Atmospheric Reentry in the Era of Mega-Constellations Jos√© P. Ferreira, Ziyu Huang, Ken-ichi Nomura, Joseph Wang, 11 June 2024</a></li>
        <li>Because they are a serious issue in the observation of space: <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/04/aa37501-20/aa37501-20.html">Impact of satellite constellations on astronomical observations with ESO telescopes in the visible and infrared domains, Olivier R. Hainaut and Andrew P. Williams, 27 February 2020</a>. Astronomers <a href="https://www.space.com/astronomers-night-sky-protection-starlink-megaconstellations">are alredy asking UN to protect night skies from mega-constellations</a>.</li>
        <li>Because they are yet another consumable. Several companies are already launching <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellites.html"></a>their own mega-constellation of satellites</a>. In a few years, tens of thousands of those competing satellites (up to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-starlink-satellites-internet">42.000 for Starlink</a>) will fly above us, their short lifespan requiring to launch thousands of new ones each year to maintain the fleet, causing important CO2 and methane emissions as well as many other environmental impacts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-left: 1rem; font-style: italic;">Our environment, our climate and our sky are common goods. They are too precious to be privatized to bring Internet access to a few privileged humans.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>I am using Starlink for [reasons] and I still want to have access to those blocked websites</h2>

    <p>Use a VPN.</p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

    <p>All the private companies running those mega-constellations own a few blocks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP (v4 and v6)</a> ranges, we are simply blocking those IPs and redirecting them to this website.</p>

    <h2>I want to support the initiative</h2>

    <p>Spread the word on your favorite social platforms, and especially to anyone you know who hosts a website (your friend, your colleague, your sewing club, your local caf√©, your government, etc.)</p>

    <p>You can also contribute to the project on <a href="https://github.com/edhelas/fuckstarlink">Github</a> by improving the blocked IP lists or adding ways to apply this list to other hosting solutions.</p>

    <h2>How do I block Starlink & co myself?</h2>

    <img src="img/mypart.webp">

    <h3>I host websites on nginx</h3>

    <p>Put the <a href="configs/nginx/fuckstarlink.conf" target="_blank">IP blocks file</a> in your <code>/etc/nginx/conf.d/</code> directory.</p>
    <p>Add the following code snippet to all the websites on which you want to apply the block:</p>

    <pre>
server {
    ...

    location = / {
        if ($starlink_user) {
            rewrite ^ https://fuckstarlink.org/;
        }
    }
    ...
}
    </pre>

    <p>To be completed with other services...</p>
